# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients in Pytorch with Simulation in PyBullet

Objective:
Use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients to find the optimal path to the destination using an environment created using pybullet. The environment contains obstacles and a goal point(soccerball). The input states to the network are images and the total area of obstacles in the scene (found using segmentation masks).
